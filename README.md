# News Scraper - MongoDB Node Express Handlebars

## KU Coding Bootcamp Week 16 Project

---

### Overview

In this assignment, I was asked to create a web app that lets users leave comments on the latest news. But I did not actually write any articles; instead, I used Mongoose and Cheerio packages along with MongoDB to scrape news from another site and store it in the apps database.



## Installation Instructions

1. Fork this repo and clone the forked repo to your computer. You will need node.js installed on your system.
2. At the command line navigate to the apps folder and run `npm install`, this will install the npm dependencies from the package.json file.
3. Install mongodb on your machine then run an instance of the db, if necessary -> https://www.mongodb.com/
4. Then run `node server.js` the console should log the port number the app will be on (currently 3001).
5. Go to your browser and type http://localhost:3001/ into the address bar to bring up the app.

## Known Issues & TODO Items

  * Add more scraped data like bylines
